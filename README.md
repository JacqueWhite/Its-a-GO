Simple event and RSVP manager. Stop planning your parties and start *enjoying* them!

### 3 simple steps:
### Red: Signup, login, create your event. You'll set:
- total cost of the event
- max cost per person
- RSVP cutoff date
### Yellow: Invite your friends. They will:
- recieve an email with the invite
- to RSVP, they will securely add their credit card information with Stripe.
### Green: It's a go!
- Once the max cost per person is less than or equal to what the creator set (from RSVPS), guest cards are charged!  The event is a go.  

### Never be stuck paying more than you agreed upon.
